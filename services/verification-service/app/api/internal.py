         the timing-safe flat-token compare (today's behaviour, unnamed peer); `static`/`jwks` verify a
         per-caller RS256 assertion. Any failure is one generic 401 — never which check failed.

         route with no policy admits any authenticated caller (default-open), so identity alone never
         breaks a path; a named allow-list yields 403 for a caller not on it.
