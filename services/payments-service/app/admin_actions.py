"""payments-service — admin actions declared for the platform admin panel (Phase 33).

The panel aggregates what every service declares HERE (it is served on /internal/manifest, so the
code is the source and the panel can never drift). Declaring nothing is fine — a service with an
empty list simply exposes no controls; keep it empty and reviewed rather than forgotten.

Each action is a PURE literal dict (the safety:admin CI gate reads it with ast.literal_eval — no
variables, no f-strings). Shape (docs/contracts/admin-actions.schema.json):

    {
        "id": "svc.do_thing",              # stable, kebab/dot, unique
        "label": "Do the thing",           # what the button says
        "method": "POST",                  # GET|POST|PUT|PATCH|DELETE (allow-listed)
        "path": "/api/v1/things/{id}/do",  # RELATIVE — no scheme/host; must be a real manifest route
        "capability": "platform.svc",      # the cap the route ENFORCES; must be advertised in the manifest
        "params": [{"name": "id", "in": "path", "type": "string", "required": True}],
        "confirm": True,                   # UX: ask before firing (auto-true when danger)
        "danger": True,                    # UX: destructive/irreversible
        "group": "Things",                 # UX: section
    }

Rules the gate enforces: the path must exist in this service's manifest `endpoints`; the capability
must be in the manifest's advertised `capabilities`; the panel is a MAP, never the AUTHORITY — every
action is re-checked at its own route on every call. Only declare OPERATOR (platform.* / *.manage /
*.read) routes; internal-token and per-user `_SELF` routes are never panel actions.
